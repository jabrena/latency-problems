Feature: God Analysis API
# REST API: GET /api/v1/gods/stats/sum
# Notes:
# - Decimal Conversion Rule: Name then each char to its Unicode int value, then concatenate these ints as strings.
# (e.g., "Zeus" -> Z(90)e(101)u(117)s(115) -> "90101117115").
# - If in the process to load the list, the timeout is reached, the process will calculate with the rest of the lists.
# - Filtering for gods starting with 'n' is case-sensitive (only lowercase 'n').

  Background:
    Given the God Analysis API is available at "/api/v1"
    And the system is configured with an API call timeout of 5 seconds

  Scenario: Happy path - Get sum with explicit sources
    When the client sends a GET request to "/gods/stats/sum" with query parameters "filter" = "n" and "sources" = "greek,roman,nordic"
    Then the response status code should be 200
    And the response body should contain a JSON object with a "sum" field
    And the value of "sum" should be "78179288397447443426"
