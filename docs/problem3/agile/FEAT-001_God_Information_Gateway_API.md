# Feature: God Information Gateway API

**Epic:** [EPIC-001_God_Information_Gateway_API.md](EPIC-001_God_Information_Gateway_API.md)  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Owner:** God Operator  
**Status:** Planning

---

## Overview

A unified API gateway that provides mythology enthusiasts with seamless access to god information from multiple ancient civilizations through a single endpoint, eliminating the complexity of querying multiple data sources.

### Business Value
- Simplifies access to comprehensive mythology data for end users
- Reduces integration complexity for applications consuming mythology information
- Provides a consistent interface regardless of the underlying data source structure
- Creates a single point of truth for god information across multiple mythologies

### Target Users
Mythology enthusiasts seeking comprehensive information about gods from various ancient civilizations

---

## Feature Description

The God Information Gateway API will serve as a central hub that aggregates god information from five distinct mythology databases (Greek, Roman, Nordic, Indian, and Celtiberian) and presents it through a unified REST API endpoint. Users will be able to query any god's information using a simple HTTP GET request without needing to know which specific mythology database contains that information.

### Key Capabilities
- Single API endpoint (`GET /api/v1/gods/{god}`) for accessing all god information
- Automatic aggregation from five external mythology APIs
- Intelligent timeout management to ensure responsive user experience
- Comprehensive error handling for reliable service delivery
- Consistent response format regardless of source mythology

### User Benefits
- **Simplified Access**: One endpoint instead of managing five different API connections
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Access to gods from Greek, Roman, Nordic, Indian, and Celtiberian mythologies
- **Reliable Performance**: Built-in timeout protection ensures responsive user experience
- **Consistent Interface**: Standardized response format across all mythology sources

## Functional Requirements

### Core Requirements
- Implement REST API endpoint `GET /api/v1/gods/{god}` for god information retrieval
- Integrate with five external mythology APIs at https://my-json-server.typicode.com/jabrena/latency-problems/
- Aggregate responses from Greek, Roman, Nordic, Indian, and Celtiberian god databases
- Return HTTP 200 status code for successful god information retrieval
- Implement 10-second timeout for external API calls
- Provide proper error handling and user-friendly error messages

### Secondary Requirements  
- Response caching for improved performance
- API usage analytics and monitoring
- Documentation for API consumers
- Health check endpoints for system monitoring

---

## Acceptance Criteria

This feature will be considered complete when:
- [ ] Gateway API successfully returns god information with HTTP 200 status for all god types
- [ ] All five external mythology APIs are properly integrated
- [ ] 10-second timeout mechanism is implemented and functioning
- [ ] Error handling provides meaningful responses for various failure scenarios
- [ ] API documentation is complete and accessible

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Code is peer-reviewed and meets quality standards
- [ ] Unit and integration tests are written and passing
- [ ] Feature documentation is complete
- [ ] Performance criteria are satisfied (10-second timeout compliance)
- [ ] All god types tested and verified to return HTTP 200 status

---

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- **Primary Dependency**: Availability and stability of https://my-json-server.typicode.com/jabrena/latency-problems/ endpoint
- Consistent response formats from all five external mythology APIs
- Network connectivity and reliability for external API access

---

## Technical Considerations

### Technical Notes
- Gateway architecture to handle multiple concurrent external API calls
- Response aggregation logic to combine data from different mythology sources
- Timeout implementation to prevent hanging requests
- Error categorization for different failure modes (timeout, API unavailable, invalid god name)

---

## Risks & Mitigation

### General Risk Areas
- **External API Dependency**: Risk of external APIs becoming unavailable
  - *Mitigation*: Implement graceful degradation and appropriate error messaging
- **Performance Variability**: External API response times may vary
  - *Mitigation*: 10-second timeout ensures consistent user experience
- **Data Consistency**: Different mythology sources may have varying data formats
  - *Mitigation*: Robust response parsing and standardization logic

---

## Success Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators
- **API Response Success Rate**: 95%+ of requests return HTTP 200 for valid god queries
- **Response Time**: 95% of successful requests complete within 10 seconds
- **Error Rate**: <5% of requests result in system errors (excluding invalid god names)

### User Satisfaction Metrics
- API uptime and availability tracking
- Response time consistency monitoring
- Error categorization and resolution tracking

---

## Timeline & Milestones

**Estimated Effort:** 2-8 weeks (Small scope as defined in epic)

### Key Milestones
- [ ] Feature requirements finalized
- [ ] Technical design completed
- [ ] Development phase started
- [ ] External API integrations implemented
- [ ] Timeout and error handling completed
- [ ] Testing completed (all god types return HTTP 200)
- [ ] Feature ready for release
