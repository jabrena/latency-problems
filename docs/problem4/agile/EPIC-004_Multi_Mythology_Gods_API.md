# Epic: EPIC-004: Multi-Mythology Gods Data Aggregation API

**Epic Owner:** God Operator
**Priority:** Medium
**Target Release:** This sprint
**Estimated Scope:** Small - 2-8 weeks

---

## Business Value & Strategic Goals

Provide a single REST endpoint to provide all god information, simplifying access to mythology data for end users by eliminating the need to interact with multiple separate APIs.

### Target Users
Mythology enthusiasts

### Success Criteria
HTTP Status 200 with all information successfully aggregated and returned in the specified JSON format.

---

## Problem Statement

Simplify for the final user extract information from multiple related data sources. Currently, users need to make separate API calls to different mythology endpoints to gather comprehensive god information across various mythologies.

---

## Solution Overview

Create a unified REST API endpoint that aggregates god data from 5 different mythology APIs (Greek, Roman, Nordic, Indian, Celtiberian) and returns the consolidated information in a single response through the `/api/v1/gods` endpoint.

---

## Key Features & Components

- **REST API endpoint implementation**: `GET /api/v1/gods` endpoint that serves as the single point of access
- **Integration with 5 external mythology APIs**: Connect to Greek, Roman, Nordic, Indian, and Celtiberian god data sources
- **Data aggregation and transformation logic**: Transform individual mythology responses into unified format
- **Timeout and connection management**: Handle connection timeouts and ensure reliable external API communication
- **Error handling and resilience**: Implement proper error handling for external API failures
- **Response formatting**: Return JSON structure with id, mythology, and god fields as specified

## User Stories

_User stories for this epic will be defined and linked here as they are created._

---

## Dependencies

Yes, the system integrates with https://my-json-server.typicode.com/jabrena/latency-problems/ which provides the external mythology APIs for:
- Greek gods: `/greek`
- Roman gods: `/roman`
- Nordic gods: `/nordic`
- Indian gods: `/indian`
- Celtiberian gods: `/celtiberian`

---

## Risks & Assumptions

### Risks
No risks identified at this time.

### Assumptions
- External APIs at my-json-server.typicode.com will remain available and stable
- Current API response format from external services will remain consistent
- Network connectivity and latency will be within acceptable ranges
