# Feature: REST API Endpoint Implementation

**Epic:** [EPIC-004_Multi_Mythology_Gods_API.md](EPIC-004_Multi_Mythology_Gods_API.md)
**Priority:** Medium
**Owner:** God Operator
**Status:** Planning

---

## Overview

Implement the core REST API endpoint `/api/v1/gods` that serves as the single point of access for aggregated mythology data from multiple external sources.

### Business Value
Provides a unified entry point for mythology enthusiasts to access comprehensive god information without needing to interact with multiple separate APIs, significantly simplifying the user experience.

### Target Users
Development team implementing the mythology data aggregation system

---

## Feature Description

This feature implements the primary REST endpoint that will handle incoming requests for aggregated mythology data and coordinate the response delivery to clients.

### Key Capabilities
- Expose GET `/api/v1/gods` endpoint
- Handle HTTP requests and responses
- Coordinate with data aggregation services
- Return properly formatted JSON responses
- Implement proper HTTP status codes

### User Benefits
- Single API call to retrieve all mythology data
- Consistent response format across all mythologies
- Simplified integration for client applications

---

## Functional Requirements

### Core Requirements
- Implement GET `/api/v1/gods` endpoint
- Return HTTP 200 status for successful requests
- Provide JSON response with id, mythology, and god fields
- Handle request routing and response formatting
- Integrate with data aggregation service

### Secondary Requirements
- Support for API versioning (v1)
- Proper HTTP headers for content type
- Request logging capabilities

---

## User Stories

### Merged User Story
- **US-001:** As a client application, I want to call GET `/api/v1/gods` and receive a successful HTTP 200 response with JSON formatted mythology data, so that I can retrieve and easily parse all mythology information from multiple sources in a single request

---
