# Feature: External API Integration Service

**Epic:** [EPIC-004_Multi_Mythology_Gods_API.md](EPIC-004_Multi_Mythology_Gods_API.md)
**Priority:** Medium
**Owner:** God Operator
**Status:** Planning

---

## Overview

Implement the service layer responsible for connecting to and retrieving data from 5 external mythology APIs (Greek, Roman, Nordic, Indian, Celtiberian) hosted on my-json-server.typicode.com.

### Business Value
Enables the system to gather comprehensive mythology data from multiple external sources, providing the foundation for the unified API response that simplifies user access to diverse mythology information.

### Target Users
Development team implementing the mythology data aggregation system

---

## Feature Description

This feature implements the integration layer that handles communication with external mythology APIs, manages HTTP connections, and retrieves raw mythology data for further processing.

### Key Capabilities
- Connect to 5 external mythology API endpoints
- Handle HTTP GET requests to external services
- Manage connection timeouts and retries
- Parse JSON responses from external APIs
- Provide consistent interface for data retrieval

### User Benefits
- Reliable access to comprehensive mythology data
- Consistent data retrieval across different mythology sources
- Robust handling of external service variations

---

## Functional Requirements

### Core Requirements
- Implement HTTP client for external API communication
- Connect to Greek gods API: `/greek`
- Connect to Roman gods API: `/roman`
- Connect to Nordic gods API: `/nordic`
- Connect to Indian gods API: `/indian`
- Connect to Celtiberian gods API: `/celtiberian`
- Parse JSON array responses containing god names
- Handle HTTP status codes (200, 500, 504)

### Secondary Requirements
- Implement connection pooling for efficiency
- Add request/response logging
- Support for configurable timeouts
- Retry mechanism for failed requests

---

## User Stories

### Suggested User Story Breakdown
- **US-005:** As a data aggregation service, I want to retrieve Greek gods data so that I can include it in the unified response
- **US-006:** As a data aggregation service, I want to retrieve Roman gods data so that I can include it in the unified response
- **US-007:** As a data aggregation service, I want to retrieve Nordic gods data so that I can include it in the unified response
- **US-008:** As a data aggregation service, I want to retrieve Indian gods data so that I can include it in the unified response
- **US-009:** As a data aggregation service, I want to retrieve Celtiberian gods data so that I can include it in the unified response
- **US-010:** As a system, I want to handle external API failures gracefully so that partial data can still be returned

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- REST API Endpoint Implementation feature (consumer)
- Data Aggregation and Transformation Engine feature (consumer)
- Resilience and Error Handling System feature (collaboration)

### External Dependencies
- REST API 1: https://my-json-server.typicode.com/jabrena/latency-problems/greek
- REST API 2: https://my-json-server.typicode.com/jabrena/latency-problems/roman
- REST API 3: https://my-json-server.typicode.com/jabrena/latency-problems/nordic
- REST API 4: https://my-json-server.typicode.com/jabrena/latency-problems/indian
- REST API 5: https://my-json-server.typicode.com/jabrena/latency-problems/celtiberian

## Technical Considerations

### Technical Notes
- HTTP client implementation (RestTemplate, WebClient, or similar)
- JSON parsing and deserialization
- Connection timeout configuration
- External service endpoint management
- Asynchronous vs synchronous API calls

---

## Risks & Mitigation

### General Risk Areas
- **Technical Complexity:** Medium complexity due to multiple external integrations and error handling requirements
- **User Adoption:** Internal service component, adoption depends on overall system success
- **Timeline Risk:** External API dependencies could impact development timeline if services are unavailable

---

## Success Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators
- External API response success rate: > 95% for each mythology endpoint
- Average response time per external API: < 2 seconds
- Data retrieval completeness: 100% of available gods per mythology

### User Satisfaction Metrics
- System reliability when external APIs are available
- Data accuracy and completeness metrics

---

## Timeline & Milestones

**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 days

### Key Milestones
- [ ] Feature requirements finalized
- [ ] Technical design completed
- [ ] Development phase started
- [ ] First working version (MVP)
- [ ] User testing completed
- [ ] Feature ready for release
