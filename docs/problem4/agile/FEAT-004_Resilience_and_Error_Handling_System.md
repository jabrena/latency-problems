# Feature: Resilience and Error Handling System

**Epic:** [EPIC-004_Multi_Mythology_Gods_API.md](EPIC-004_Multi_Mythology_Gods_API.md)
**Priority:** Medium
**Owner:** God Operator
**Status:** Planning

---

## Overview

Implement comprehensive resilience and error handling mechanisms to ensure reliable operation when dealing with external API failures, timeouts, and connection issues while maintaining system stability and user experience.

### Business Value
Ensures mythology enthusiasts receive reliable service even when external data sources experience issues, maintaining system availability and providing graceful degradation of service rather than complete failure.

### Target Users
Development team implementing the mythology data aggregation system

---

## Feature Description

This feature implements robust error handling, timeout management, and resilience patterns to handle various failure scenarios when integrating with external mythology APIs, ensuring the system remains stable and responsive.

### Key Capabilities
- Handle connection timeouts to external APIs
- Manage HTTP error responses (500, 504)
- Implement retry mechanisms for failed requests
- Provide graceful degradation for partial failures
- Maintain system stability during external service outages
- Log errors for monitoring and debugging

### User Benefits
- Consistent API availability even during external service issues
- Partial data delivery when some mythologies are unavailable
- Improved system reliability and user experience
- Transparent error communication

---

## Functional Requirements

### Core Requirements
- Implement connection timeout handling for external API calls
- Handle HTTP 500 (Internal Server Error) responses from external APIs
- Handle HTTP 504 (Gateway Timeout) responses from external APIs
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- Provide partial response when some mythologies fail
- Log all error conditions for monitoring
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes for different error scenarios
- Implement circuit breaker pattern for failing services

### Secondary Requirements
- Configurable timeout values per mythology API
- Fallback data sources or cached responses
- Health check endpoints for external service monitoring
- Error rate monitoring and alerting
- Request correlation IDs for debugging

---

## User Stories

### Suggested User Story Breakdown
- **US-018:** As a system, I want to handle connection timeouts gracefully so that slow external APIs don't cause system failure
- **US-019:** As a system, I want to retry failed requests so that temporary external service issues don't impact users
- **US-020:** As a user, I want to receive partial mythology data when some sources are unavailable so that I still get value from the API
- **US-021:** As a developer, I want detailed error logs so that I can troubleshoot integration issues
- **US-022:** As a system administrator, I want circuit breakers so that failing external services don't cascade failures
- **US-023:** As a user, I want clear error messages so that I understand when and why the service is degraded

- Error recovery rate: > 90% of temporary failures resolved through retries
- Partial response delivery: 100% when at least one mythology API is available
- Mean time to recovery: < 30 seconds for transient failures

### User Satisfaction Metrics
- User experience during degraded service scenarios
- Error message clarity and usefulness
- Service reliability perception
