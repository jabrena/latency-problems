## Overview

Implement the core data processing engine that aggregates raw mythology data from multiple external APIs and transforms it into the unified JSON response format with id, mythology, and god fields.

### Business Value
Transforms disparate mythology data sources into a consistent, unified format that provides mythology enthusiasts with a seamless experience when accessing comprehensive god information across different mythologies.

### Target Users
Development team implementing the mythology data aggregation system

## Feature Description

This feature implements the central data processing logic that takes raw god name arrays from multiple mythology APIs and transforms them into a structured, unified response format suitable for client consumption.

### Key Capabilities
- Aggregate data from 5 different mythology sources
- Transform god name arrays into structured objects
- Generate unique identifiers for each god entry
- Combine all mythology data into single response
- Ensure consistent data format across mythologies

### User Benefits
- Unified data structure for easy client processing
- Consistent identification system across mythologies
- Complete mythology dataset in single response
- Standardized field naming and format

## Functional Requirements

### Core Requirements
- Process Greek gods array and transform to structured format
- Process Roman gods array and transform to structured format
- Process Nordic gods array and transform to structured format
- Process Indian gods array and transform to structured format
- Process Celtiberian gods array and transform to structured format
- Generate unique ID for each god entry
- Create unified response with id, mythology, and god fields
- Combine all mythology data into single JSON array

### Secondary Requirements
- Support for data validation and cleansing
- Handle duplicate god names across mythologies
- Implement data sorting capabilities
- Support for extensible mythology addition
