# ADR-001: Acceptance Testing Strategy for Mythology Aggregation Service

## Status
**Accepted** - *Date: 2024*

## Context

We are developing a mythology aggregation service that provides a unified REST API endpoint (`/api/v1/gods`) for retrieving mythology data from multiple external sources. The service aggregates data from 5 external mythology APIs (Greek, Roman, Nordic, Indian, and Celtiberian) and presents it in a standardized JSON format.

### Technical Context
- **Technology Stack:** Spring Boot, Maven, Java
- **Team Size:** Solo developer with good testing experience
- **Development Approach:** Outside-in Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- **Existing Infrastructure:** CI/CD pipeline already in place
- **Main Consumers:** API operators
- **Performance Requirements:** Response time < 5 seconds for complete aggregation

### External Dependencies
The service integrates with 5 reliable third-party mythology APIs:
- Greek mythology API (`/greek`)
- Roman mythology API (`/roman`)
- Nordic mythology API (`/nordic`)
- Indian mythology API (`/indian`)
- Celtiberian mythology API (`/celtiberian`)

Each external API returns an array of god names as strings and may respond with 500 or 504 error codes.

### Current State
- No existing acceptance tests in place
- Well-defined API contract and requirements captured in Gherkin scenarios
- OpenAPI specifications available for external services with example data

## Decision

We will implement a **comprehensive acceptance testing strategy using REST Assured with WireMock for external service stubbing**, integrated into our existing CI/CD pipeline to run on every commit.

### Core Strategy Components

#### 1. Testing Framework and Tools
- **Primary Tool:** REST Assured for API testing
- **Mocking Strategy:** WireMock for stubbing external mythology APIs
- **Test Data Management:** Static JSON response files based on OpenAPI specification examples
- **Integration:** Maven build lifecycle with existing CI/CD pipeline

#### 2. Test Implementation Approach
- **Specification-Driven:** Use existing Gherkin scenarios as acceptance criteria and specification
- **Implementation Style:** Write REST Assured tests directly in Java (no Cucumber runner overhead)
- **Test Structure:** Follow Given-When-Then patterns inspired by Gherkin scenarios
- **Scope:** Focus on API contract validation, response format verification, and integration behavior

#### 3. External Service Handling
- **Mock All External APIs:** Use WireMock to stub all 5 mythology APIs for acceptance tests
- **Static Test Data:** Leverage response examples from OpenAPI specifications
- **Error Scenario Testing:** Include stubbed 500 and 504 responses to test error handling
- **No Real External Calls:** Acceptance tests will not hit actual external services to ensure speed and reliability

#### 4. Test Execution Strategy
- **Frequency:** Run on every commit as part of CI/CD pipeline
- **Feedback Loop:** Fast execution to support outside-in TDD workflow
- **Environment:** Tests run against Spring Boot test context with WireMock stubs
- **Reporting:** Standard Maven Surefire/Failsafe reporting integrated with CI/CD

#### 5. Test Coverage Areas
Based on existing Gherkin scenarios:
- **Happy Path:** Successful aggregation of all mythology data
- **Response Format:** JSON structure validation with required fields (id, mythology, god)
- **Data Completeness:** Verification that all 5 mythologies are included
- **Performance:** Response time validation (< 5 seconds)
- **Error Handling:** External service failure scenarios
- **API Contract:** HTTP status codes, content types, and response structure

## Rationale

### Why REST Assured?
- **Developer Experience:** Natural fit for Spring Boot API testing
- **Expressiveness:** Fluent API makes tests readable and maintainable
- **Integration:** Excellent Maven integration and CI/CD compatibility
- **Solo Developer Efficiency:** No additional framework overhead (avoiding Cucumber)

### Why Mock External Services?
- **Speed:** Fast test execution supports TDD feedback loops
- **Reliability:** Eliminates external dependencies that could cause test flakiness
- **Control:** Ability to test error scenarios and edge cases consistently
- **Cost:** No external API call costs or rate limiting concerns
- **Determinism:** Predictable test results essential for CI/CD pipeline

### Why Run on Every Commit?
- **Outside-in TDD Support:** Immediate feedback when implementing against specifications
- **Early Bug Detection:** Catch integration issues before they compound
- **Solo Developer Workflow:** No coordination overhead, can afford frequent testing
- **Existing CI/CD:** Leverage existing infrastructure investment

### Why Static Test Data?
- **Maintenance Simplicity:** Test data evolves with OpenAPI specifications
- **Realistic Scenarios:** Based on actual external API examples
- **Version Control:** Track test data changes alongside code changes
- **Solo Developer Efficiency:** Minimal setup and maintenance overhead

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup
1. **Configure Maven Dependencies**
   - Add REST Assured and WireMock test dependencies
   - Configure Maven Failsafe plugin for integration tests

2. **Create Test Infrastructure**
   - Set up WireMock server configuration for tests
   - Create static JSON response files for each mythology API
   - Establish base test class with common setup

### Phase 2: Core Test Implementation
1. **Happy Path Tests**
   - Implement successful aggregation scenario
   - Validate response structure and data completeness
   - Verify performance requirements

2. **Error Scenario Tests**
   - External service failure handling
   - Partial failure scenarios
   - Response validation under error conditions

### Phase 3: CI/CD Integration
1. **Pipeline Integration**
   - Configure tests to run on every commit
   - Set up proper test reporting
   - Define failure criteria and notifications

### Phase 4: Test Maintenance Framework
1. **Documentation**
   - Document test data management process
   - Create guidelines for adding new test scenarios
   - Establish test maintenance procedures

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- **Fast Feedback:** Developers get immediate feedback on API contract compliance
- **Reliable Testing:** No external dependencies means consistent test results
- **TDD Support:** Testing strategy aligns perfectly with outside-in TDD approach
- **Documentation:** Tests serve as living documentation of API behavior
- **Confidence:** High confidence in deployments due to comprehensive acceptance coverage
- **Maintainability:** Static test data and simple toolchain reduce maintenance overhead

### Challenges to Monitor
- **Test Data Drift:** Static test data may diverge from real external API responses over time
- **Integration Gaps:** Mocked tests won't catch issues with actual external service integration
- **Test Maintenance:** As API evolves, tests need consistent updates
- **Performance Reality:** Mocked services may not reflect real performance characteristics

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Regular External API Validation:** Periodic manual verification against real external services
- **Test Data Reviews:** Regular review of static test data against external API documentation
- **Performance Monitoring:** Use application monitoring to validate real-world performance
- **Integration Test Suite:** Consider separate integration test suite for periodic real external API testing

## Review and Updates
This ADR should be reviewed when:
- External API contracts change significantly
- Performance requirements are modified
- Team size or structure changes
- CI/CD pipeline undergoes major changes
- Testing tools or framework versions have breaking changes
